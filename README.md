# Optimized Job Selector for FiveM

This script is an optimized version of `if-jobselectorv1`,

This version was developed by @deamonalex for Paradise Island RP. 
It has been enhanced for better performance, security, and user experience in job selection within the FiveM platform.

THIS VERSION IS FOR QB-CORE ONLY

## Original Script Support
Support for the original script can be found at [IF-Developments Discord](https://discord.gg/if-developments). 

**Note:** There is no support available for this optimized version of the script.

## Enhancements and Changes

### Performance Optimization
- Implemented tables for faster job data access, reducing the computational overhead and improving overall script performance.

### Job Validation
- Added checks to validate job selection. This ensures players can only select jobs that are available and properly defined within the server configuration.

### Whitelisted Jobs
- Introduced a system for whitelisted jobs. Players can view all available jobs, but selection is restricted to jobs that are not whitelisted. Attempting to select a whitelisted job will notify the player that an application is required for that specific job.

## Installation and Usage

1. Place the optimized script files into your server's resources directory.
2. Ensure the script is correctly referenced in your server's configuration.
3. Start the server. The job selector should now be enhanced with the new optimizations.
